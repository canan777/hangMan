'Hangman' is a simple web game. This project offers a fun gaming experience using web technologies.

<h1>objective of the game</h1>: 
One person chooses a word from the other person. The person playing the game starts guessing without knowing how many letters the chosen word contains and which letters it contains. A line is drawn under each letter so that it can be seen how many letters the word has. The player guesses the letters of the chosen word. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is written on the line of that letter. If the guessed letter is not in the word, this is recorded as a "wrong guess". A "man" drawing is used and a piece is added for each wrong guess. Once a certain number of wrong guesses have been made, the game ends and the "man" is complete. If a player guesses the word up to a certain number of wrong guesses, that player wins. "Congratulations you have won" is announced.
